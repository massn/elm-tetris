# elm-tetris

Tetris game continued from YouTube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C8fMD-89DKhlerIE3BrYNd0PlhA6Zch).
Since the YouTube tutorial ended at episode 15 and I wanted to continue to develop the Tetris game, I continued in this repository.

Thanks to [jcollard](https://github.com/jcollard) a.k.a. Captain Coder for making the awesome tutorial.

## Development

```
$ elm-reactor
```

## Controls

* Left, right and down to control piece.
* `n` or `m` to rotate the piece.
* `h` to hide/show next piece.
